Im ngl, I barely remember how this works, but it should, might have some files missing, or have a bunch of extra files. :D
note: this code is based on someone elses code (as all code is) unfortunately I dont remember whos code I based it on but it should have quite a lot of changes for whatever reasons I had to make them. 


actual helpful tip: you will need an api key to upload stuff.
